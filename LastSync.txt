    realtek: pcs: rtl930x: drop conditional SerDes setup
    
    We can now setup most of the modes for RTL930x, recently XSGMII, QSGMII
    and USXGMII-SX have been added. Thus we don't need a big list of allowed
    modes anymore in SerDes setup. Drop this without replacement. Other
    modes are still rejected in other places or will be rejected later with
    a proper SerDes capability handling.
